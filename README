*textobj-function* is a Vim plugin to provide universal text objects for
various kinds of functions.  For example, you can select any function with
|<Plug>(textobj-function-a)| / |<Plug>(textobj-function-i)| (default key
bindings: af / if).

The definition of a "function" is usually differed depending on what you are
editing, so at first, you have to tell the definition of what kind of function
you want to select to textobj-function.  By default, textobj-function knows
about functions in the following languages:
					    *textobj-function-known-languages*
- C language		|textobj-function-c|
- Vim script		|textobj-function-vim|

If you want to tell about more functions in other languages, see
|textobj-function-customizing| for how to tell and
after/ftplugin/*/textobj-function.vim for the samples.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.7 or later (vimscript#2100)
